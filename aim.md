The aim of this experiment is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the **Poisson random process**, a fundamental stochastic process widely used in modeling random events occurring over time or space. Through this experiment, students will:

- Visualize the emergence of Poisson Process form Bernoulli Process
- Analysis of Posisson Process and properties from real world phenomenon.
- Analysis of Inter-Arrival Times.
