### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the **Poisson random process**, a fundamental stochastic process widely used in modeling random events occurring over time or space. Through this experiment, students will:

-   Explore the properties and characteristics of the Poisson process.
-   Understand its assumptions, including the independence of increments.
-   Simulate Poisson processes using computational tools.
-   Analyze real-world phenomena modeled by Poisson processes, such as:
    -   Emission of radioactive particles from a source.
    -   Arrival times of customers at a queue or service center.
    -   The emergence of random events from a large number of potential sources.
