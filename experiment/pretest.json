      "explanations": {
        "a": "Binomial distribution applies to fixed trials with success/failure outcomes.",
        "b": "Exponential distribution models the time between events.",
        "c": "Correct! The number of events in a fixed interval is Poisson distributed. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution'>Details here</a>",
        "d": "Uniform distribution assumes all outcomes are equally likely, which doesn't apply here."

      "question": "2. What is a key characteristic of a Poisson process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Events occur at regular intervals",
        "b": "Events occur independently over time",
        "c": "Only one event can occur in total",
        "d": "Events always follow a normal distribution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Poisson processes model random, not regular, events.",
        "b": "Correct! Events in a Poisson process are independent of one another. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process'>Learn more</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "$\\lambda$ is the rate per unit time; we must scale it by time.",
        "b": "Incorrect, mean is not additive in this case.",
        "c": "Correct! The expected number of events = $\\lambda * t$. <a href='https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoissonDistribution.html'>Reference</a>",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Poisson models number of events, not time between them.",
        "b": "Correct! Inter-arrival times in a Poisson process are exponentially distributed. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution'>Read more</a>",
        "c": "Normal distribution isn't appropriate for modeling waiting times here.",

        "c": "Events can occur simultaneously",

        "a": "Independence is a core property of the process.",
        "b": "A constant rate $\\lambda$ is essential for a homogeneous Poisson process.",
        "c": "Correct! In a Poisson process, the probability of two events occurring at exactly the same instant is zero. <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-262-discrete-stochastic-processes-spring-2011/3a19ce0e02d0008877351bfa24f3716a_MIT6_262S11_chap02.pdf'>Source</a>",
